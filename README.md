## 🧠 Project Overview

This system uses **AI + Simulation + Smart Traffic Control** to detect emergency vehicles using:

✅ **Visual Detection** – YOLO (YOLOv5 / YOLOv8) + OpenCV  
✅ **Audio Detection** – Siren recognition using MFCC + ML/DL  
✅ **Light Bar Detection** – HSV color filtering + Haar Cascade  
✅ **Indicator Detection** – Route prediction via blink pattern analysis  
✅ **Traffic Control** – SUMO + TraCI to trigger dynamic green signals
